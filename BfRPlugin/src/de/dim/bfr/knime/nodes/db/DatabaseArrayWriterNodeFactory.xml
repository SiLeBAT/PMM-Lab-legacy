    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	Establishes and opens a preconfigured connection to a database. 
        	The connection settings are taken from the information provided 
        	by the user in KNIME's preferences dialogue. Make sure you have 
        	filled in all necessary information. The node scans the data at 
        	the input port and checks whether the database contains the 
        	corresponding tables or not. If all corresponding tables exist, 
        	all data from the input port tables will be written to the 
        	corresponding database tables.
